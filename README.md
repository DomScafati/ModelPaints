# Model Paints üé®

**Model Paints** is a Swift package that expands the standard color sets available in Swift and SwiftUI with a palette inspired by miniature painting.  
It provides convenient access to color values modeled after the iconic Citadel paint range, making it easy to add thematic or hobby-related flair to your projects.
